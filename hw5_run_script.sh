# To run:
#	bash hw_run_script.sh

# This script assumes you have compiled your solution and called
# the executable "parser", as shown:

#	flex <filename>.l
#	bison <filename>.y
#	g++ <filename>.tab.c -o parser

# This script also assumes you have the provided sample input files from
# Canvas in a directory called "sample_input", and the expected output files
# in a directory called "expected_output". It also requires two
# empty directories named "actual_output" and "reports".

# The script will produce a side-by-side comparison of your output
# to the expected output. Any lines that have a "|", "<", or ">"
# mark differences between the files.

# Note that we are no longer redirecting the input with `<`; you need to
# have changed your bison file to accept command line input as described
# in the assignment description.

inputs=`ls sample_input --ignore-backups`
